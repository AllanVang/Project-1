About:
This program will play a choose your own adventure style game using binary tree. There 
are two parts to this program. The creating your own character, and the adventure portion.
The character creator portion uses what we learn from pass classes with getters, setters, accessors etc.
The adventure portion is structured based off a binary tree. Where each decision is a child node of the parent.


Reasoning:
While brainstorming for a project idea, the professor was teaching us about binary trees. 
We saw binary trees, and thought about how it could be implemented to as a flow chart for 
decision based game. So that's what we went for. 

Complexity:
This program runs in O(n) complexity primarily because of it having to read from a script.txt file.
This code does not handle large calculations, and we thought this was far more appropriate than hard
coding all the story lines withing the programing .cpp file. 

How to run:
Download all .h and .cpp files, and compile them in visual studios.
